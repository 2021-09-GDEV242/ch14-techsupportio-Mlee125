crash, crashes
Well, it never crashes on our system. It must have something
to do with your system.tell me more about your configuation.

slow
I think this had to do with your hardware.
Upgrading your processor should solve all performance problems.
Have you got a problem with our software?

performance
Performance was quite adequate in all our tests. 
Are you running any other processes in the background?

bug, buggy
Well, you know, all software has some bugs. 
But our software engineers are working very hard to fix them.
Can you describe the problem a bit further?

windows
This is a known bug to do with Windows operating system.
Please report this to Microsoft.
There is nothing we can do about this.

macintosh
This is a known bug to do with Mac operating system.
Please report this to Apple.
There is nothing we can do about this.

expensive
The cost of our product is quite competitive.
Have you looked around and really compared our features?

installation
The installation is really quite straight forward. We have 
tons of wizards that do all the work for you.
Have you read the installation instructions?

memory
If you read the system requirements carefully,
you will see that the specified memory requirements are 1.6 giga byte.
You really should upgrade your memory.
Anything else you want to know?

linux
We take Linux support very seriously. But there are some
problems. Most have to do with incompatible glibc versions.
Can you be a bit more precise?

bluej
Ahhh, BlueJ yes. We tried to buy out those guys a long time ago,
but they simply won't sell... Stubborn people they are.
Nothing we can do about it, I'm afraid.
